Go sdk for [Artifacts MMO](https://artifactsmmo.com). Hand built with love.

Artifact MMO Client: https://artifactsmmo.com/client

## Getting Started

**Install gopherfacts**
```bash
go get github.com/thestuckster/gopherfacts
```

**Using gopherfacts**
```go
import "github.com/thestuckster/gopherfacts/pkg/clients"

func main() {

    //check the artifacts server status
    statusInfo, err := sdk.CheckServerStatus()
    if err != nil {
        logger.Error().Err(err).Msg("Artifacts Server isnt healthy, check back later.")
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    
    token := "YOUR_TOKEN"
    character := "YOUR_CHARACTER"
    
    // create the client
    gopherfacts := clients.NewClient(&token)
    
    //Character client is the basic functionality client.
    res, err := gopherfacts.CharacterClient.Move(character, 1, 1)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
	//CharacterClient will NOT handle cooldowns, you must manage them yourself.
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(res.Cooldown.RemainingSeconds) * time.Second)
    
    //EasyClient provides easier to use functionality and WILL handle the cooldowns before returning its result
    res, err := gopherfacts.EasyClient.MoveToBank(character)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
